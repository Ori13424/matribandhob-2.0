## 🔐 Role-Based Access Guide

The app enforces strict role-based redirects. To test all features, create three separate accounts:

1. **Patient App:**
* Go to `/patient` (or click "I am a Mother").
* Sign up. (Role is automatically set to `patient`).


2. **Doctor Console:**
* Go to `/doctor`.
* Click "Register Access". (Role is automatically set to `doctor`).


3. **Driver App:**
* Go to `/driver`.
* Click "Register Unit". (Role is automatically set to `driver`).



> **Tip:** Open the Doctor Console in one browser window and the Patient/Driver apps in Incognito windows to test real-time interactions like Chat, SOS, and Tracking simultaneously.
